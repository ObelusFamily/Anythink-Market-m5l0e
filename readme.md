## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_
1. Git clone this repo (guess you're already done that)
2. Install Docker
3. Run ```docker-compose up``` from the base directory
4. See it breaks
5. Go to discord and find the answer
6. Run again and see it failed
7. Ask for assistance, apply it
8. Run again ```docker-compose up``` 
9. Violla!
